Mastering the Art of Pitch Decks: BERT vs GPT Models

This repository presents a detailed comparison of BERT and GPT models in the context of creating pitch decks. It explores how each model handles content generation, slide organization, and messaging to produce clear, persuasive, and well-structured presentations. The aim is to highlight the strengths and differences between the two approaches and provide insights for anyone interested in understanding their practical applications.

The repository contains pitch decks that showcase the output and structure generated using both BERT and GPT models. These decks are intended to demonstrate how each model can influence the clarity, flow, and overall effectiveness of a presentation.

Users can browse the uploaded pitch decks to see side-by-side examples and analyze which model might be better suited for different types of presentations or messaging goals.

Contributions are welcome.
